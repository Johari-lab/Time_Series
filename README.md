# Time Series Analysis of CO2 emissions from the industrial sector in the United States

The aims of the present study are to identify a model best fitting the CO2 emissions data from the industrial sector in the USA (in Millions of Tm), and to forecast the CO2 emissions for the year 2020. The method of maximum likelihood was used to estimate the parameters and to forecast the number of CO2 emissions in the future. The data from 1990 to 2019, which have been documented annually by the US Energy Information Administration, reveal that the ARIMA (0,1,1)(0,1,1)12 model, corrected by calendar effects and outliers may fit most adequately and forecast that the CO2 emissions from the industrial sector in the USA will reach approximately 1531.54 Millions of Tm the next year, which explains 7.18 times increase compared to the number of CO2 emissions reported in 2019 (under the assumption that current political, social, and economic conditions will be persistent in the future). The US government must be advised to be prepared for possible increases in greenhouse gas emissions due to the decision to abandon the Paris agreement by the Trump administration. The reduction of CO2, among other harmful gases for the environment, is crucial in order to limit global warming and to preserve a planet similar to that in which civilizations have developed
